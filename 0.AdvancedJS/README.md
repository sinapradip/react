# let vs var vs const

When working with JavaScript, understanding the differences between `let`, `var`, and `const` is crucial for writing clean and efficient code. Here's a brief explanation of each:

## `var`

- **Scope**: `var` is function-scoped, meaning it is accessible within the function it is declared in. If declared outside a function, it becomes globally scoped.
- **Hoisting**: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope, meaning they can be used before they are declared, but their value will be `undefined` until the declaration is encountered.
- **Re-declaration**: `var` allows re-declaration within the same scope, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

```javascript
function example() {
  console.log(x); // undefined
  var x = 10;
  console.log(x); // 10
}
example();
```

## `let`

- **Scope**: `let` is block-scoped, meaning it is only accessible within the block (enclosed by `{}`) it is declared in.
- **Hoisting**: Variables declared with `let` are also hoisted, but they are not initialized. Accessing them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.
- **Re-declaration**: `let` does not allow re-declaration within the same scope, which helps prevent bugs.

```javascript
function example() {
  // console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined
  let y = 20;
  console.log(y); // 20
}
example();
```

## `const`

- **Scope**: Like `let`, `const` is block-scoped.
- **Hoisting**: `const` variables are hoisted but not initialized, similar to `let`.
- **Re-declaration**: `const` does not allow re-declaration within the same scope.
- **Assignment**: Variables declared with `const` must be initialized at the time of declaration and cannot be reassigned. However, if the variable is an object or array, its properties or elements can be modified.

```javascript
function example() {
  const z = 30;
  console.log(z); // 30
  // z = 40; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable

  const obj = { a: 1 };
  obj.a = 2; // Allowed
  console.log(obj.a); // 2
}
example();
```

## Summary

- Use `var` for function-scoped variables (though generally discouraged in modern JavaScript).
- Use `let` for block-scoped variables that may need to be reassigned.
- Use `const` for block-scoped variables that should not be reassigned.

Understanding these differences helps in writing more predictable and maintainable code.

# Arrow Functions

Arrow functions, introduced in ES6, provide a concise syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. They are particularly useful for writing shorter function expressions and maintaining the context of `this`.

## Syntax

The basic syntax of an arrow function is as follows:

```javascript
const functionName = (parameters) => {
  // function body
};
```

If the function has a single parameter, the parentheses can be omitted:

```javascript
const functionName = parameter => {
  // function body
};
```

If the function body contains a single expression, the curly braces and `return` keyword can be omitted:

```javascript
const functionName = (parameters) => expression;
```

## Examples

### Basic Example

```javascript
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};
```

### Single Parameter and Implicit Return

```javascript
const square = x => x * x;
```

### No Parameters

```javascript
const greet = () => console.log('Hello, world!');
```

## Differences from Regular Functions

### `this` Context

One of the key differences between arrow functions and regular functions is how they handle the `this` keyword. In regular functions, `this` refers to the object that called the function. In arrow functions, `this` is lexically bound, meaning it retains the value of `this` from the enclosing context.

#### Regular Function Example

```javascript
function Person() {
  this.age = 0;

  setInterval(function() {
    this.age++; // `this` refers to the global object (or undefined in strict mode)
    console.log(this.age);
  }, 1000);
}

const person = new Person();
```

In the above example, `this` inside the `setInterval` callback does not refer to the `Person` instance, leading to unexpected behavior.

#### Arrow Function Example

```javascript
function Person() {
  this.age = 0;

  setInterval(() => {
    this.age++; // `this` refers to the Person instance
    console.log(this.age);
  }, 1000);
}

const person = new Person();
```

In this example, `this` inside the arrow function retains the value from the enclosing `Person` function, correctly referring to the `Person` instance.

### No `arguments` Object

Arrow functions do not have their own `arguments` object. If you need to access the arguments passed to an arrow function, you can use the rest parameter syntax:

```javascript
const sum = (...args) => {
  return args.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
};
```

## Summary

Arrow functions provide a shorter syntax for writing functions and offer benefits such as lexical scoping of `this`. They are particularly useful for writing concise function expressions and maintaining the context of `this` in callbacks and other situations.


## Array Methods (map, filter, reduce)

Array methods such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are essential tools in JavaScript for manipulating and transforming arrays. These methods are part of the functional programming paradigm and help in writing clean and concise code.

## `map`

The `map` method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

### Syntax


```javascript
const newArray = array.map(callback(element, index, array) {
  // return value for newArray
});
```

Example:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
console.log(doubled); // [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
```js
const people = [
  'Creola Katherine Johnson: mathematician',
  'Mario José Molina-Pasquel Henríquez: chemist',
  'Mohammad Abdus Salam: physicist',
  'Percy Lavon Julian: chemist',
  'Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar: astrophysicist'
];

const listItems = people.map(person => <li>{person}</li>)

return <ul>{listItems}</ul>;
```


## `filter`

The `filter` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

### Syntax

```javascript
const newArray = array.filter(callback(element, index, array) {
  // return true to keep the element, false otherwise
});
```

### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(num => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // [2, 4]
```

## `reduce`

The `reduce` method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.

### Syntax

```javascript
const result = array.reduce(callback(accumulator, currentValue, index, array) {
  // return updated accumulator
}, initialValue);
```

### Example

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
console.log(sum); // 15
```

## Summary

- **`map`**: Transforms each element in an array and returns a new array.
- **`filter`**: Filters elements in an array based on a condition and returns a new array.
- **`reduce`**: Reduces an array to a single value by accumulating results.

These array methods are powerful tools for working with arrays in JavaScript and are widely used in modern JavaScript development, including React.

In the provided code, the functionality to increment the `count` by 1 each time the button is clicked is achieved using **React's `useState` hook**. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Key Components:
1. **`useState` Hook**:
   ```javascript
   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
   ```
   - `useState` is a React hook that allows you to add state to a functional component.
   - It initializes the `count` state variable with a value of `0`.
   - `setCount` is a function provided by `useState` to update the value of `count`.

2. **Button Click Handler**:
   ```javascript
   <button onClick={() => setCount((count) => count + 1)}>
     count is {count}
   </button>
   ```
   - The `onClick` event is triggered when the button is clicked.
   - The `setCount` function is called with a callback function:
     ```javascript
     (count) => count + 1
     ```
     - This callback receives the current value of `count` and increments it by 1.
   - React re-renders the component with the updated `count` value.

3. **Dynamic Rendering of `count`**:
   ```javascript
   count is {count}
   ```
   - The current value of `count` is displayed dynamically inside the button using JSX.

### How It Works:
1. Initially, `count` is set to `0` (as defined by `useState(0)`).
2. When the button is clicked:
   - The `onClick` handler calls `setCount`, which updates the `count` state by incrementing it by 1.
   - React detects the state change and re-renders the component.
3. The updated `count` value is displayed in the button text.

### Example Flow:
- Initial render: `count is 0`.
- Button clicked once: `count` becomes `1`, and the button displays `count is 1`.
- Button clicked again: `count` becomes `2`, and the button displays `count is 2`.

This is how `useState`, `count`, and `setCount` work together to manage and update the state dynamically in response to user interactions.
